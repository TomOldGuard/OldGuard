			<h1>Finding the &#8216;one true way&#8217; of the web</h1>
			<p>As designers and developers we seem to be constantly in search of the correct way of doing things &#8211; the one, singular, true way &#8211; the definitive, and only, method of accomplishing a task. All alternatives are unacceptable. This leads to <em>a lot</em> of arguments in our community. But, really, do most of these things make a difference? Do they matter?</p>
<p><span id="more-462"></span></p>
<p>Like writing your own CSS? OK. Like using tables for laying out websites? Ah, that&#8217;s not so goodâ€¦ How about using a compiler or a framework? That&#8217;s fine.<br/>Like working in photoshop? Great.<br/>Prefer designing in the browser? That&#8217;s fine too.<br/></p>
<p>The end user will never notice the difference, and they certainly won&#8217;t care. We can lose sight of this easily; users are the most important thing when building a website, not getting caught up in the minutiae of <em>how</em> we build or create something.</p>
<p>Choice of technique is not my way or the highway. There are of course broad rights and wrongs, but the rights make up a much broader spectrum than many think. How many flame wars/arguments are there regularly about this across blogs and Twitter?! It&#8217;s great that people are passionate, but I can&#8217;t help thinking how much further we could move forward if more of the discussion was positive.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I had a discussion about Twitter with another web designer at a meet up. I described how I use Twitter (I follow a small number of people and read every tweet in my timeline). That&#8217;s what works best for me. He was insistent that I was doing it wrong and his approach was the only way to use Twitter. He follows a LOT of people and skims the timeline for interesting tweets to read. I tried to patiently explain that I had given his approach a go and that it wasn&#8217;t for me. This went unnoticed and I was told again that I was doing it all wrong. </p>
<p>For me it really boils down to this &#8211; I don&#8217;t necessarily think you should do what I do, but in exchange I don&#8217;t want you to tell me your way is the only way. A lot of this is general human nature, but we are especially blighted by this in our industry.We don&#8217;t need these &#8216;I&#8217;m right and unless you&#8217;re doing exactly the same you&#8217;re wrong&#8217; discussions. If it works for you then that&#8217;s what matters. </p>
<p>It is the end experience that is important. I keep returning to that fact that 99.9% of the general internet using public will use a website blissfully unaware of any technical or design decisions that were made. They just want a good experience. And that&#8217;s the way it should be. </p>
